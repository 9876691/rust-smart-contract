\chapter{Conclusion and Thoughts}

\section{Developer Experience}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item It took me about 4 hours to setup a reproducable development environment using 
        VSCode dev containers \cite{containers}
    \item This was tested on windows and osx. Allowing me to compile, test and 
        run up a test node. 
    \item I was able to leverage my existing Rust skillset which helped a lot.
    \item The learning curve is steep due to heavy use of the rust type system. 2 Toolchains
        at the same time. And new terminolgy i.e. Parachains etc etc.
    \item There is a tutorial \cite{tutorial}
    \item There is some presence on StackOverflow \cite{overflow}
    \item Incremental build of a contract is just over 1 second.
    \item I use rust-analyzer to give me intellisense and to point out compilation issues as
        I type. This worked well but it did give me red marks for compilation errors
        which didn't get flagged on the command line.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Deployment}

I was able to to get a test node up and running. Unfortuantely I couldn't get the 
user interface to connect to my local node. This may be that I'm running the 
from within a docker container.
I was able to use the Restful API to get blochcian information. In time I could get
this working.

\section{Integration Testing and Simulation}


\begin{enumerate}
    \item I have high confidence that I could build a CI/CD pipeline an deploy direct to a testnet.
        This would make the workflow between development and simulation much easier.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Todo}

To complete the PoC and cover all the risks of this technolgy I would need to do the following.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Add functions and structs to manage a negotiation workflow.
    \item Deploy a staging environment.
    \item Deploy a minimal UI that can interact with a node.
\end{enumerate}
